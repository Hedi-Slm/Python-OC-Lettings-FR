Project Description
===================

Overview
--------

OC Lettings Site is a Django web application that allows users to view information about rental properties and user profiles.
The application has been refactored from a monolithic architecture to a modular architecture with three distinct apps to improve maintainability and scalability.

Project Objectives
------------------

The main goal of the project was to modernize an existing application by applying best development practices:

* Refactoring from a monolithic architecture to a modular architecture
* Implementing monitoring and observability
* Setting up an automated CI/CD pipeline
* Improving code quality with tests and linting
* Providing complete technical documentation

Modular Architecture
--------------------

The application is now organized into three distinct modules:

**oc_lettings_site**
    Main application containing the Django configuration, global views.

**lettings**
